# stock_screener

A basic stock screening console application. The user can enter a stock by inputting the ticker symbol (eg. AAPL) and then request:

- A general stock overview
- Stock data from the current day
- The company balance sheet

The data is sourced through the Alpha Vantage API and then formatted using Pandas. An API key is needed to use the application.

These can be acquired free from the Alpha Vantage website directly: https://www.alphavantage.co/
